# a summary about you
summary: "<span style='font-weight: bold'>Over a decade of experience in various tech disciplines ranging from software development and project management to DevOps and system administration, network administration, software support, and cybersecurity.</span> Iâ€™ve built my career on continuously learning and adapting, and I enjoy tackling projects that drive me to continually expand my expertise.
<br><br>
As a project manager, I've led various software development projects using tools such as Jira, Kanban, ClickUp, and Microsoft Project. I've employed agile, waterfall, scrum, and hybrid approaches to drive project delivery, effectively addressing client needs and resolving issues. Additionally, I've overseen DevOps activities for testing and deployment, utilizing Docker solutions to enhance scalability and security. 
<br><br>
I bring extensive expertise in web services, system design and administration, and database design and management. Leveraging these skills, I've architected robust systems, built scalable web services, and optimized databases to boost performance and reliability. My work rests on solid technical foundations and a commitment to delivering dependable, impactful outcomes.
